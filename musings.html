<h2 id="o500-15-nov-2014">O500 15 Nov 2014</h2>

<p>I initially built, I guess, a Github <em>project page</em> called <code>ronjeffries.github.io/ronjeffries</code>. Perhaps / probably, what I really want is a <em>user page</em>, which would be called <code>ronjeffries.github.io</code>.</p>

<p>Both, it appears, can contain a web site kind of thing, so perhaps(?) it doesn’t matter. If it does matter, I’m not clear on just how it matters.</p>

<p>I build the <code>/ronjeffries</code> one with the “automatic page generator”, where you pick a theme and a bunch of stuff, so it now has in it a gh-pages branch, where the web content is stored. that is all it has, apparently, i.e. it does not have a master branch.</p>

<p>A user page, on the contrary, would build itself from its master branch. There may be some arcane reason why this difference is there. </p>

<p>It sounds as if the user page expects to find one’s entire jekyll stuff in master? and will actually build the site, using jekyll, at github?</p>

<p>Does that mean that if i set up a <code>ronjeffries.github.io</code> repository and push the current contents of my rj-com folder (where our jekyll stuff is) to that repository, then http://ronjeffries.github.io will look like the rj-com stuff?</p>

<p>If so, before I tried that, I think I’d like to strip back out the 400 extra folders that are in there.</p>

<h2 id="nov-2014">0545 15 Nov 2014</h2>

<p>This repository: <code>https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io</code> generates this site: <code>http://tom.preston-werner.com</code> whose “real” address is <code>mojombo.github.io</code>.</p>

<p>The repository looks not unlike my rj-com folder. So possibly, if I were to create a repository ronjeffries.github.io and push rj-com to it, then <code>http:ronjeffries.github.io</code> would actually look like the local rj-com stuff.</p>

<p>Seems almost doable. Will have to learn how to push rj-com to other than its current origin?</p>

<h2 id="strangely-confused">Strangely Confused</h2>

<p>I feel like there are three things that I would need to understand before I understood enough of this to do it. As it stands right now, I feel like if I do the wrong thing I’ll break the internet or something.</p>

<p>It has been a long time since I felt this way, if I ever have. Apparently I am outside my comfort zone with a programming kind of thing. Or I am coming down with Impostor Syndrome. Or becoming stupid. That would be bad.</p>

<h2 id="nov-2014-1">1020 15 Nov 2014</h2>

<p>Progress. I followed instructions at <code>https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/</code> and created a minimal index.html and made a github <em>page</em> at <code>http://ronjeffries.github.io/musings/</code>. </p>

<p>This entails, for a github <em>page</em>, making and pushing a branch whose name must be gh-pages. All it really needs to contain is an index.html, apparently</p>

<p>Then I added a link to index.html, pointing to info.html or something. Then I used kramdown to convert this markdown file to html. That turns out to require a template, which works if you make it refer to <code>body</code> in the place where you might think it’d say <code>yield</code>. There is essentially no information on the Internet about how to use kramdown on the command line. </p>

<p>That turns out to be <code>kramdown --template musings.erb musings.md &gt;&gt;musings.html</code> in my case.</p>

<p>After some futzing with the file names, and I wish I hadn’t named everything musings, I got this page, converted to HTML, linked to from the base page of the site. I have now added a link to a second html, <code>project</code>, where I was planning to write up what the xprogramming conversion project is, as an aid in a twitter um discussion I’m having with Woody and Neil.  I might defer that to learn more about this basic process, perhaps bridging my understanding gap between this much, and how to use jekyll in this process.</p>

<p>Right now, to regenerate this tiny site, I’ll have to re-kramdown all the articles (all two of them if i do <code>'project</code>), then add them to git, commit, and push the branch. Basically jekyll is a giant batch file that does that, so it should not be TOO difficult to get it to do much of it.</p>
