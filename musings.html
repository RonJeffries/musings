<p>I initially built, I guess, a Github <em>project page</em> called <code>ronjeffries.github.io/ronjeffries</code>. Perhaps / probably, what I really want is a <em>user page</em>, which would be called <code>ronjeffries.github.io</code>.</p>

<p>Both, it appears, can contain a web site kind of thing, so perhaps(?) it doesn’t matter. If it does matter, I’m not clear on just how it matters.</p>

<p>I build the <code>/ronjeffries</code> one with the “automatic page generator”, where you pick a theme and a bunch of stuff, so it now has in it a gh-pages branch, where the web content is stored. that is all it has, apparently, i.e. it does not have a master branch.</p>

<p>A user page, on the contrary, would build itself from its master branch. There may be some arcane reason why this difference is there. </p>

<p>It sounds as if the user page expects to find one’s entire jekyll stuff in master? and will actually build the site, using jekyll, at github?</p>

<p>Does that mean that if i set up a <code>ronjeffries.github.io</code> repository and push the current contents of my rj-com folder (where our jekyll stuff is) to that repository, then http://ronjeffries.github.io will look like the rj-com stuff?</p>

<p>If so, before I tried that, I think I’d like to strip back out the 400 extra folders that are in there.</p>

<h2 id="nov-2014">0545 15 Nov 2014</h2>

<p>This repository: <code>https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io</code> generates this site: <code>http://tom.preston-werner.com</code> whose “real” address is <code>mojombo.github.io</code>.</p>

<p>The repository looks not unlike my rj-com folder. So possibly, if I were to create a repository ronjeffries.github.io and push rj-com to it, then <code>http:ronjeffries.github.io</code> would actually look like the local rj-com stuff.</p>

<p>Seems almost doable. Will have to learn how to push rj-com to other than its current origin?</p>

<h2 id="strangely-confused">Strangely Confused</h2>

<p>I feel like there are three things that I would need to understand before I understood enough of this to do it. As it stands right now, I feel like if I do the wrong thing I’ll break the internet or something.</p>

<p>It has been a long time since I felt this way, if I ever have. Apparently I am outside my comfort zone with a programming kind of thing. Or I am coming down with Impostor Syndrome. Or becoming stupid. That would be bad.</p>
